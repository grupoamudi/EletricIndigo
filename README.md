- You need to create a AP on your computer with the ssid: eletricIndigo and password indigoEletric
- You need to create a virtual MIDI device (https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209774225-Using-virtual-MIDI-buses-in-Live)
- You need to install python rtmidi library (http://trac.chrisarndt.de/code/wiki/python-rtmidi/install-windows) even though this is for windows it helps for other OSs
- then run Ableton go to preferences and check all the boxes for the virtual input MIDI you created
